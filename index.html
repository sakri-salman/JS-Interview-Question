1 What is javaScript
. javascript is Interpreted Language:Single Thred Language.
. Dynamic Typing:JavaScript is loosely typed, meaning variables can hold different types of data at different times.




2 what is data type

. there are primative and non-primative
. primative data type is 7 ( number, string, bulean, null, Symbol ,float,bigint);
. non primative is has refarence in globle exegution context ( array,object,funtion);



console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof "hello"); // "string"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (this is a known quirk in JavaScript)
console.log(typeof {}); // "object"
console.log(typeof []); // "object"
console.log(typeof function(){}); // "function"



3 different between null and undifind

Meaning: A variable is declared but has not been assigned a value yet

let x; // Variable is declared but not assigned
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function greet() {}
console.log(greet()); // Output: undefined (function has no return value)

let obj = {};
console.log(obj.name); // Output: undefined (property does not exist)



Meaning: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

let y = null; // Variable is explicitly set to have no value
console.log(y); // Output: null

let person = { name: "Alice" };
person.name = null; // Explicitly clear the value of the property
console.log(person.name); // Output: null


console.log(undefined == null);  // true (type coercion makes them equal)

4 different between primative and non primative

.These are the basic data types that represent single values.
. Immutable: Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed (although you can reassign the variable itself). 

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
. These are data types that can store collections of values or more complex entities.
. Mutable: Their content (properties or elements) can be changed.

5 what are variable

. variable are three type var, let, conts.
. let salman; => it is call variable declaration/
. let salman="man" => it is call variable

let x;         // Declaration
x = 10;        // Assignment
console.log(x); // Output: 10

6 different between var let conts

. var is globle and function Scope. reassigned and re-declared within the same scope. undifind
. let is block scope. reassigned but cannot be re-declared in the same scope. temporal dead zone
. const is block scope.Cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
. Feature	             var	      let	          const
 Scope	         Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
 Reassignable	  Yes	             Yes	          No
 Re-declarable	  Yes	             No	              No
 Initialization	  Optional	        Optional	     Mandatory
 Hoisting	      Yes 	             Yes (temporal dead zone)	Yes (temporal dead zone)
            (initialized as undefined)



7 what is scope

. visibility and accessibility of variables within a specific part of your code

8 what is lexical scop



9 what is hoisting

. variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution

10 how is javascript work

. there is a call-stack
. in call-stack we have a globle execution context



11 oprator in javascript  (see in operator folder);



12 funtion  Statement , Expression, Declaration


. function a(){} ===>is called funtion Statement or Declaration Both are same
. const a=funtion (){}  ===> is called funtion Expression
. funtion statement or declaration are hoisted and funtion expression are not hoisted

13 what is Anonymous funtion

. function() { } ===> a funtion statement or Declaration with out name is called anonymous funtion
. used as an argument, or returned by another function 
  const a =funtion (){}  ==> it is argument
  const a = funtion(){
    return funtion(){}   ==> it is return by another funtion
  }


  14 what is name funtion expression
  . funtion a(){} it is called named funtion 
  . const a=funtion a(){} it is called funtion 

  15 Different between parameter and arguments
  . the funtion statement or expression declared is called parameter (a1, a2) it is called local variable
  . when funtion called by its name and give value a(1,2) it is called arguments


  16 what is first class Function / first class citizen
  . both are same 
  . passing funtion inside another function as a argument is called first class function a(xyz)
  . function can be return by another funtion is called first class funtion


  17 Arrow Function 


**  Synchronous And Asynchronus
Synchronus: The Code is Executed line by line
Asynchronus: It Executed Independently.


*** What is Event Loop 

it is a mechanism to execute asynchronus code. it continuouly Check the call Stack is emty , when call stack is emty it take out task from callback queue


*** what is a closure in 

to access its lexical scope    

child function to keep environment of its perent scope evenafter the parents funtion has already executed.


*** promises 

handle asynchronus task (task is completed or not);
promises have Pending, Fuifilled and Rejected;
use  new Promise(), resolve , reject()


what is call(); apply()


















************************************React js


***********what is react js 

reac js is javascript library. it is easy to understatnd



**********what is virtual DOM 

virtual Dom has a duplicated of real dom. when any update in dom virtual dom update and it compare the real dom only update by render in real dome is process called diffing

*************what is jsx

it is a javascript XML
Traspilers are used to convert jsx into javaScript

************ what is conditionsl rendering *************************

render component or ui by specific condition 

1 if / else
2 using ternary operator
{logic ?  :  } 





********explain props and statement

props is used pass data from one component to another component
props cannot be modified

state passed within the component 
it is modified



********** what is state **************

it is any object that holds some information of component it may change over lifetime of the component




******** what is higher-order component 


like app.js is a higher-order component it take all component.



********************explain one way data binding ************

data flow in one way like parent to child when parent date is update child automaticly re-render



************ explain lifecycle method ***************

mounting : component render is called mounting
updating: when state of component is update is call updating
unmounting: when delete any componet is call unmounting

************ explain methods used in mounting phase****************

componentwillMount()
vthis function is invoked before the component is mounted on dom


componentDidMount()
function is invoked after the compoent is mounted on dom



**********************what is setState()**********


setStat() it ensure that the compoent has updated and it call re-render of component



 ******************* what is useState hook ***************

 using this hook we declare a state variable in function
state variable store component data


********************** what is useEffet hook **************
