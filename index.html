1 What is javaScript
. javascript is Interpreted Language:Single Thred Language.
. Dynamic Typing:JavaScript is loosely typed, meaning variables can hold different types of data at different times.




2 what is data type

. there are primative and non-primative
. primative data type is 7 ( number, string, bulean, null, Symbol ,float,bigint);
. non primative is has refarence in globle exegution context ( array,object,funtion);



console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof "hello"); // "string"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object" (this is a known quirk in JavaScript)
console.log(typeof {}); // "object"
console.log(typeof []); // "object"
console.log(typeof function(){}); // "function"



3 different between null and undifind

Meaning: A variable is declared but has not been assigned a value yet

let x; // Variable is declared but not assigned
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function greet() {}
console.log(greet()); // Output: undefined (function has no return value)

let obj = {};
console.log(obj.name); // Output: undefined (property does not exist)



Meaning: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

let y = null; // Variable is explicitly set to have no value
console.log(y); // Output: null

let person = { name: "Alice" };
person.name = null; // Explicitly clear the value of the property
console.log(person.name); // Output: null


console.log(undefined == null);  // true (type coercion makes them equal)

4 different between primative and non primative

.These are the basic data types that represent single values.
. Immutable: Once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed (although you can reassign the variable itself). 

Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
. These are data types that can store collections of values or more complex entities.
. Mutable: Their content (properties or elements) can be changed.

5 what are variable

. variable are three type var, let, conts.
. let salman; => it is call variable declaration/
. let salman="man" => it is call variable

let x;         // Declaration
x = 10;        // Assignment
console.log(x); // Output: 10

6 different between var let conts

. var is globle and function Scope. reassigned and re-declared within the same scope. undifind
. let is block scope. reassigned but cannot be re-declared in the same scope. temporal dead zone
. const is block scope.Cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
. Feature	             var	      let	          const
 Scope	         Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
 Reassignable	  Yes	             Yes	          No
 Re-declarable	  Yes	             No	              No
 Initialization	  Optional	        Optional	     Mandatory
 Hoisting	      Yes 	             Yes (temporal dead zone)	Yes (temporal dead zone)
            (initialized as undefined)



7 what is scope



8 what is lexical scop



9 what is hoisting


10 how is javascript work

. there is a call-stack
. in call-stack we have a globle execution context
